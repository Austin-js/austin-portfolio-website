        <p><br>
          My name is Austin. I'm a self-learned developer and I love automating and building systems that make life easier.<br><br>(and more fun!)

          <br>
          Has 3+ years of experience mainly as a Python/Backend Developer.
          Worked on Web3 Ethereum bots, Flask based web systems and apps, and customized AI chatbots for businesses.
          <br><br>
          I formerly go by the developer name "Austin_js" when I started on Fiverr.
          Eventually, I stopped freelancing on Fiverr when they restricted crypto-related services similar to my previous projects.

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          <br>
          I did not actually graduate from any computer science related course, and it was actually one of my regrets.
          Since I was a kid, I have always loved tinkering and creating scripts with my computer back then!
          <br><br>
          During the pandemic, I first took interest of Forex and crypto trading to try and make money. It was then I realized I could make scripts to automate our trading strategies.
          <br><br>
          I learned MQL4 and MQL5 to create our first original trading bots with my friends. We shared and sold it to other people, and it was a bit successful in the short term.
          We stopped because the bot was not entirely perfect. We didn't like the risk being given to our clients.
          <br><br>
          Eventually, I transitioned to trading cryptocurrency and I learned about the Ethereum blockchain. I found out I can automate transactions using Python and Web3.
          I developed bots that can snipe tokens during their launch. I started being a Freelancer on Fiverr and sold my services there.
          <br><br>
          For 2 years, I was working as a freelancer - being able to work with many clients. My work was mostly about automating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
          During this time, I learned a lot with my experiences on Python, took several different Python and CS courses, and did side projects to improve my skills.
          I was playing around with AI around this time too (regarding photo generation and chatbots).
          However, I had to stop freelancing on Fiverr when they restricted crypto-related services similar to my previous projects.
          <br><br>
          I transitioned by looking for a remote full-time job, and I was able to get a job as a Python/Backend Developer.
          On the side, I am also working on my own projects related to AI that would help businesses.
